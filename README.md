Shutdown.Tools is a public open source library of tools, websites, strategies that could be used by HRDs, journalists, and anyone, during **internet outages**. 

This project is an ongoing effort, if you would like to help in building this library through categorising the projects, updating the descriptions or building the website, please submit a pull request to this repo.

Goal by the end of this week: 
- No more Lorem Ipsum.
- Add all warnings.
